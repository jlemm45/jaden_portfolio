## Bio

I solve problems with valuable products and tools. In reality, no product is ever unique. It’s already been done. Success is created from execution not ideas. Competitors are a signal of market validation.

I’m a software engineer at heart. I’ve been coding since 4th grade. I recognize the importance and balance of writing the best code vs managing timely expectations during product early stages.

I build successful teams around products ready to execute. Some of my product success includes some of these products.

### [Voyage](https://voyageapp.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=portfolio_repo&utm_campaign=general)

Voyage automatically generates an isolated environment and a unique URL you can send to the entire team.

### [Actovos](https://actovos.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=portfolio_repo&utm_campaign=general)

Actovos streamlines messages and responses for important events such as an emergency foster care placement or important notifications within the DOD.

### [Oyster](http://oysterapp.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=portfolio_repo&utm_campaign=general)

A location-based mingling app that helps you find nearby singles in real time and initiate conversations in real life.

Oh and if you ever catch me out of work you may find me playing 18 holes on the golf course, riding my bike along the Oklahoma river, or capturing some drone footage of downtown Oklahoma City.
